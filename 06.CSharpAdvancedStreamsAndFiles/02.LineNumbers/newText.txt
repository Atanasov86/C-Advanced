0     This problem is from the C# Basics Exam (19 December 2014). You can test your solution here.
1     You are given a painting canvas of size 10 x 10, divided into 100 cells. 
2     Initially, the canvas is white (all cells have a value of 1). You shoot black and white paint balls with different sizes at the canvas. 
3     White is represented by 1s and black is represented by 0s.
4     You alternate between black and white paint after each shot; the first shot is always with black paint (0s), the second is white (1s), 
5     the third is black again and so on. 
6     You will be given each shot's impact row and column coordinates as well as the ball's radius. 
7     The impact area is a square, its center is the impact cell; all cells in the impact area change values to either 0 or 1, depending on the color of the paint.
8     After you run out of ammo (when you receive the string "End" from the console) the canvas will be some combination of 1s and 0s.
9     Each row of the canvas represents a binary integer number. 
10    Your task is to find the sum of the 10 numbers and print it to the console. 
11    An example where a single shot with parameters "4 5 2" was fired is shown below.
12    The impact cell is shaded black, the splashed cells in the impact area are shaded grey.
